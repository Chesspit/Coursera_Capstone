"The world is on the move! In these times people have become quite flexible. It is common to go to a different country to start a new job. **But how do you find the right neighborhood in a city you do not know?**

"Well, you certainly know the neigborhoods in the city in which you are currently living. You know which mix of **features** (shopping, restaurants, entertainment, green parks, public transport, education...) you are looking for. Thus you can provide **a point of reference** to find the right place somewhere else. And since you are not familiar with the new city you might be particularly concerned about safety and housing prices.

"Again, Toronto will serve as the city of interest. A neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, will be the point of reference. Obviously both choices (origin & destination) are exchangeable.

"**Problem:** *Find feasible neigborhoods in Toronto based on your preferences?*"
